# ðŸŽ¨ CSS Course 2022 ðŸŽ¨

Welcome to the CSS 2022 Course!

This repo contains all of the exercises used in the 2022 CSS Course by Colt Steele and Branon Eusebio.

## The Projects

### Blog Post (Typography Project)

The Typography project is a small exercise in which we build a small web page with various typography styles to get a feel for working with fonts.

### Bloom Digital (Image Project)

Image Hero is a small project in which we build a Hero section of a website.

### Kicks World (Positioning Project)

Kicks World is a medium project where we create a shoe store product page, leveraging a lot of different positioning styles. 

### Cost Estimator (Flexbox Project) ###

### Portfolio Project (Grid Project) ###

### Swipe (**Big** Project)

Swipe is the big, final project of the course! Swipe is a fictitious payments API company, with a super snappy and well-designed UI. By building Swipe, we tie together all or the course concepts covered and more!

#### Running The Project

To run Swipe, we recommend the Live Server extension. Open the `index.html` file in your IDE and click `Go Live` in the bottom bar to run the file with Live Server. Since it's a static, 2-3 file project this will be sufficient to run the site completely!
